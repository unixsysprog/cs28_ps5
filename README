  Student: William Gottschalk
  Date: 4/17/2018

Summary:

  This submission contains the files:

    Makefile    -- the makefile
    Plan        -- a description of the design and operation of my code
    typescript  -- a sample run

  builtin.c - houses the logic to determine whether a shell command is a builtin
      c command such as cd or ls.
  builtin.h - header files for builtin.c

  controlflow.c - contains functions that update the control flow logic when
      when processing the bash scripts. It has logic to determine whether to
      execute a then or else block of an if statement.
  controlflow.h - header files for controlflow.c

  flexstr.c - flexible string implementation. Provided to us. Unmodified.
  flexstr.h - flexible string header file. Provided to us. Unmodified.

  process.c - functions for determining whether to execute a builtin command
      or to fork a child process and exec it.
  process.h - header files for process.c 

  smsh5.c - the entry point to the application. Defines a function called
      execute_file which begins processing a file stream (either stdin or a 
      particular filename).

  splitline.c - contains functions for splitting the cmdline string into an
      array of arguments. Unmodified.
  splitline.h - header files for splitline.c. Unmodified.

  varlib.c - tracks the environment and bash variables stored for a process.
      also performs variable substitution on the cmdline string before it 
      gets split into and arglist by splitline.
  varlib.h - header files for splitline.c

Notes:
  Sorry about the late submission. I found the assignment to be challenging to
  get started but I loved working on it. I feel that a lot of dots got connected
  because of this assignment.
